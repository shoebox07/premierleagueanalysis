Exploratory Multivariate Data Analysis on the Premier League

This is an exploratory analysis on the premier league using different multivariate statistical methods. This project allowed me to play around with player data from FIFA 20 through utilizig these methods. 

This was my final project for S&DS 363 - Multivariate Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences at Yale University. 

The PDF file is my analysis and the R markdown file contains my code. 

This project has inspired me to use other types of data to explore other sports and leagues to build a sports betting algorithm. 

This analysis and code can definitely be improved. Please feel free to look through the analysis or the code.
